description: Following their honeymoons, Lucilla and Evelyn set up housekeeping with
  their husbands, Chester and Max, in a new shared home, Sunnyside. The family enjoys
  a round of parties held in honor of the newlyweds. When Max returns to the navy,
  the rest of the family travels with Grandma Elsie during the cold months on board
  the Dolphin to several Caribbean islands and the shores of South America. Elsie
  and Ned Raymond acquire pet monkeys, and Ned takes an unfortunate tumble but is
  saved by a quick-thinking sailor.
